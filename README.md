Personal data science exploration using python (pandas, numpy, sklearn, scipy, matplotlib)

#### My journey in:

1. Exploring data science through working with common ML models on UCSI datasets.

2. Developing numerical simulations for engineering problems 
      - Finite Difference Analysis on 1D and 2D Heat Transfer (wip)
      - Finite Element Method (coming soon)
      
3. Building a web app for analysing investments decision through: (wip)
      - aggregating financial statements of companies in a single database,
      - displaying relevant metrics in a visually appealing manner,
