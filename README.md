Data science exploration using python (pandas, numpy, sklearn, scipy, matplotlib) 

## My journey in:

1. Exploring data science through working with common ML models on online datasets.

2. Developing numerical simulations for engineering problems 
      - Finite Difference Analysis on 1D and 2D Heat Transfer `(wip)`
      - Finite Element Method `(planned)`
      
3. Building a web app for analysing investments decision through: https://dizzydwarfus-investments-dashb-v1.streamlit.app/
      - aggregating financial statements of companies in a single database,
      - displaying relevant metrics compactly,
      - perform DCF based on manual input parameters,
      - show growth charts and comparison with industry.
