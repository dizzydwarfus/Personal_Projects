Data science exploration using python (pandas, numpy, sklearn, scipy, matplotlib) 

## My journey in:

1. Exploring data science through working with common ML models on online datasets.

2. Developing numerical simulations for engineering problems 
      - Finite Difference Analysis on 1D and 2D Heat Transfer `(wip)`

3. Learning python through hands-on mini-projects
